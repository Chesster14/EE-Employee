-- In this file, you want to 'seed' your data tables (which you created in your schema.sql file) with initial rows or records

-- In order to seed a data table with a record, you will use the insert into command in SQL
-- So, INSERT INTO yourDatatableNameGoesHere (col1, col2, col3, ...) VALUES (val1, val2, val3, ...);

-- Run INSERT INTO statements for all the three data tables. In other words, you want to seeds all tables with some 
-- initial records or rows
